Description:  <br />
In this project, introducing a system which sterilizes and wash the fruits and vegetables scientifically. The washing machine is designed in kitchen environment. This system is excellent blending of bio-chemistry and electronics engineering. The dissolved ozone and diluted white acetic acid (white vinegar) act as a good sterilizer and then the vegetables are dehydrated to reduce the effect of pesticides. Vinegar is very good at removing the waxes or “films” on produce like apples.
It is even more effective at this than either bleach or peroxide.Heat sterilization is the most effective process of food preservation. 
By this method all microorganisms are completely destroyed due to high temperature. One of the traditional methods of preserving process of fruits and vegetables is a thermal treatment, which involves the use of heat, i.e. increased temperatures. Heat treatment is carried out by methods of sterilization, pasteurization and blanching, thus hermetically sealed packaging is used (usually made of metal, glass or plastic). Fruits, vegetables and their products represent a significant segment of the human diet, as they create the preconditions of proper nutrition. From a global point of view fruits and vegetables are present
in the human diet all over the world, but it is also interesting that the relatively large producers of fruits and vegetables are developing countries.
With changing time and development in technology, we have considered designing such an instrument that will be useful to everyone. This is a portable washing machine that removes minute dust, residual agricultural pesticides and bacteria on surface of fruits and vegetables by producing ozone and ultrasonic wave simultaneously. It effectively cleans off contaminants in curved or hard-to-reach parts in fruits and vegetables than when rinsing off with just water, and other materials thereby keeps food safe and fresh.
